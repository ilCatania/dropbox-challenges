Assumptions made in the file-events program:

FE0. input raw events are sorted by time stamp ascending
FE1. raw events can only be of type ADD or DEL
FE2. file content modifications are logged as a DEL event immediately followed by an ADD event on the same path with a different hash
FE3. file renames are logged as a DEL event followed by an ADD event on the same path up to the last level but one, with the same hash
FE4. a file cannot be both modified and moved in a single pass: a DEL event followed by an ADD event with different path and hash will count as an actual deletion followed by a creation
FE5. when a non-empty folder is deleted, deletion events related to contained elements will precede the deletion event of the folder itself
FE6. when a non-empty folder is moved, deletion events related to contained elements will precede the deletion event of the folder itself, and creation events related to contained elements will follow the creation event of the new folder
FE7. when a non-empty folder is moved, all DEL events must precede all ADD events
FE8. multiple raw events that compose a single structured event (e.g. a move) are not required to have the exact same timestamp
FE9. all file paths start with a single slash and cannot contain two consecutive slashes
FE10. when a non-empty folder is moved, DEL events and subsequent ADD events appear in the same order with respect to the respective files moved

Possible structured event types:
file/folder creation
file/folder deletion
file content modified
file moved
folder moved
