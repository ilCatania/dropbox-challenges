Assumptions made in the file-events program:

FE0. input raw events are sorted by time stamp ascending
FE1. raw events can only be of type ADD or DEL
FE2. file content modifications are logged as a DEL event immediately followed by an ADD event on the same path with a different hash
FE3. file renames are logged as a DEL event followed by an ADD event on the same path up to the last level but one, with the same hash
FE4. only one action may be performed at a time on a file or folder between move, rename or edit: therefore a DEL event followed by an ADD event with different path and hash will count as an actual deletion followed by a creation
FE5. when a non-empty folder is deleted, deletion events related to contained elements will follow the deletion event of the folder itself
FE6. when a non-empty folder is moved, each DEL event (including those related to contained elements) will be immediately followed by the corresponging ADD event
FE7. (none)
FE8. multiple raw events that compose a single structured event (e.g. a move) are not required to have the exact same timestamp
FE9. all file paths start with a single slash and cannot contain two consecutive slashes
FE10. (none)
FE11. (none)

Possible structured event types:
file/folder creation
file/folder deletion
file content modified
file moved
folder moved
