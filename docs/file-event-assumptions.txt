Assumptions made in the file-events program:

FE0. input raw events are sorted by time stamp ascending
FE1. raw events can only be of type ADD or DEL
FE2. file content modifications are logged as a DEL event immediately followed by an ADD event on the same path with a different hash
FE3. file and folder renames are logged as a DEL event followed by an ADD event on the same path up to the last level but one, with the same hash (where applicable)
FE4. only one action may be performed at a time on a file or folder between move, rename or edit: therefore a DEL event followed by an ADD event with different path and hash will count as an actual deletion followed by a creation
FE5. when a non-empty folder is deleted, deletion events related to contained elements will follow the deletion event of the folder itself
FE6. when a non-empty folder is moved or renamed, deletion events related to contained elements will follow the deletion event of the folder itself, and add events will follow the add event of the folder itself
FE7. when a non-empty folder is moved or renamed, the order of deletion events matches the order of add events
FE8. multiple raw events that compose a single structured event (e.g. a move) are not required to have the exact same timestamp. More generally, timestamps are ignored except for display purpose
FE9. all file paths start with a single slash and cannot contain two consecutive slashes
FE10. when a folder is created with the same name of a folder currently being deleted, it is considered as being moved
FE11. a folder cannot be moved inside one of its subfolders
FE12. all events related to a single structured action must be available at the time of processing

Possible structured event types:
file/folder creation
file/folder deletion
file content modified
file moved
folder moved
